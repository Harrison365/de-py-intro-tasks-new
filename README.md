# Python Foundations

This repo is split into three distinct sections:

-   **Part 1** offers you the opportunity to get to grips with some of the basic syntax in Python. It will encourage you to predict behaviour, fix bugs and explore the pythonic tools available.

-   **Part 2** will introduce function syntax. It aims to allow you develop your problem solving techniques in a new language. Tests are already written using a basic function. _We will look at a more formal approach to TDD in a later session._ The functions mainly focus of string manipulation, numerical calculations with use cases for conditional and iterative logic. **For guidance on using the tests and a suggested running order please read the `instructions.md` file**.

-   **Part 3** introduces some more complicated data types. Lists, dictionaries, sets and tuples will be involved in all of these functions. Like part 2, the functions have some rudimentary prewritten tests to help drive development. You should aim to solve these functions using comprehensions. **For guidance on using the tests and a suggested running order please read the `instructions.md` file**.

## Virtual Environment

Before working on this repo, remember you'll need to create a virtual environment. To do this run the command

```sh
python -m venv venv
```

which should create a `venv` directory at the root of your project. Run the _activate_ binaries using

```sh
source venv/bin/activate
```

Don't forget to deactivate your virtual environment afterwards with:

```sh
deactivate
```
