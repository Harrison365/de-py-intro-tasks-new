# Create the function measure_words which takes a string of words separated by
# commas. It should return a dictionary which records the length of each word.
# Each property should be of the form str: int, where the key is in lowercase.
# You can assume the string will not contain duplicate words.

# eg. measure_words('Ficus, Alocasia, Begonia') => {'ficus': 5, 'alocasia': 8, 'begonia':7}
