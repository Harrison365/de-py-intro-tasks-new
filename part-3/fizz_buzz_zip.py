# Create the function fizz_buzz_zip which takes two lists of integers and combines them into one list element from each list between each other (like a zip!)
# If the number is divisible by three, the element should be replaced with the string 'fizz'.
# If the number is divisible by five, the element should be replaced with the string 'buzz'.
# If the number is divisible by three and five, the element should be replace with the string 'fizzbuzz'.

# eg. fizz_buzz_zip([1,3,5,1,2],[4,2,2,1,15]) => [1, 4, 'fizz', 2, 'buzz', 2, 1, 1, 2, 'fizzbuzz']
