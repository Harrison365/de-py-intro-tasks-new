# Create the rock_paper_scissors which takes two players' choices for the game.
# The functions should returns a string indicating which player has won.
# You can assume that player 1's choice will take the first positional argument.


# eg. rock_paper_scissors('rock', 'paper') -> 'player 2 wins!'
#     rock_paper_scissors('scissors', 'paper') -> 'player 1 wins!'
